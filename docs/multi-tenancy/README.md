One of the best ways to leverage cloud compute environments is multi-tenant architecture. A tenant can be anything here - a user, a group of users, another application or something else. While multiple tenants can share compute resources easily, storage resources are better off being dedicated to each tenant. Not only this isolates data specific to tenants, it also makes sure your setup is highly scalable. As each storage resource is completely independent of another - there is no extra complexity involved in adding or managing storage resources.

This document provides an outline to achieve highly scaleable multi-tenant architecture with Minio as your cloud storage.

## Multi-tenancy for applications
User facing applications like mobile and browser based apps generally need access to Minio storage to upload or download objects. In such cases it isn't secure to share Minio storage credentials to each tenant. Instead, it is better to use temporary Presigned URLs to provide a secure and effective way to access the cloud storage.

As Presigned URLs are generated by the Minio server, someone still needs to send a request to generate a Presigned URL. To do this, you can create a thin controller layer that works as the interface between all tenants and corresponding Minio instances. This layer knows the Minio instances credentials and when requested by a tenant, it can send a request to corresponding Minio server instance and generate a Presigned URL. The URL can then be passed on to the tenant for temporary use.

## Multi-tenancy for non-applications
Applications that provide storage directly to the users are better deployed in a multi-tenant fashion (ideally one per tenant). With one Minio instance serving just one user, it becomes easy to manage server upgrades, maintainance downtimes etc. As each Minio instance already has its own credentials, there is no overhead of creating and managing credentials. While the data is completely isolated from each other.
