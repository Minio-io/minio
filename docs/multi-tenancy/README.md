# Multi-tenancy in Minio [![Slack](https://slack.minio.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.minio.io) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/minio/minio)](https://goreportcard.com/report/minio/minio) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/minio/minio.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/minio/minio/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/minio/minio)

One of the best ways to leverage cloud compute environments is multi-tenant architecture. A tenant can be anything here - a user, a group of users, another application or something else. While multiple tenants can share compute resources easily, storage resources are better off being dedicated to each tenant. Not only this isolates data specific to tenants, it also makes sure your setup is highly scalable. As each storage resource is completely independent of another - there is no extra complexity involved in adding or managing storage resources.

This document provides an outline to achieve highly scaleable multi-tenant architecture with Minio as your cloud storage.

## Multi-tenancy for applications
User facing applications like mobile and browser based apps generally need access to Minio storage to upload or download objects. In such cases it isn't secure to share Minio storage credentials to each tenant. Instead, it is better to use temporary Presigned URLs to provide a secure and effective way to access the cloud storage.

As Presigned URLs are generated by the Minio server, someone still needs to send a request to generate a Presigned URL. To do this, you can create a thin controller layer that works as the interface between all tenants and corresponding Minio instances. This layer knows the Minio instances credentials and when requested by a tenant, it can send a request to corresponding Minio server instance and generate a Presigned URL. The URL can then be passed on to the tenant for temporary use.

## Multi-tenancy for non-applications
Applications that provide storage directly to the users, can be setup with multiple Minio instances (ideally one per tenant). This way each tenant has their own credentials and their data is completely isolated from each other.

## Ways to deploy multiple Minio instances
Once you have finalized the scope of your Minio deployment, it is important to understand how to deploy and manage multiple Minio instances. While the deployment choices boil down to your specific requirements, we will outline various options available here.

### Single machine deployment
To deploy multiple Minio instances on a single machine, you can use different ports on the same machine. In the example below, there are 3 minio instances on ports 9001, 9002 and 9002, running on the same machine but independent of each other.

*Run Minio-1*:
```
minio --config-dir /data/conf1 server --address :9001 /data/export1
```

*Run Minio-2*:
```
minio --config-dir /data/conf2 server --address :9002 /data/export2
```

*Run Minio-3*:
```
minio --config-dir /data/conf3 server --address :9003 /data/export3
```

### Cluster deployment
While deploying Minio in a cluster, you can either use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, DC/OS, Docker Swarm etc. or manage the cluster and Minio instances yourself. While orchestration platforms take care of mapping the requests and endpoints, you'll need to do that yourself in a self managed cluster. Reverse proxies such as Nginx or Traefik can help achieve this.

#### Container orchestration platform deployment
Minio can be easily deployed on all the major orchestration platforms. Refer [this document](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-deployment-quickstart-guide) to get started with Minio on orchestration platforms.  

#### Run Minio behind reverse proxy
In the example config below, a proxy runs on port 80 and reverse proxies the requests to Minio-1 or Minio-2 or Minio-3 depending on the access-key in the client request.

Let's assume:
* Minio-1's access key is ROML2P775VPAT7RLPOWU
* Minio-2's access key is ENT3GYJCKCD1Q79XLP4C
* Minio-3's access key is C988WQ23D98207ELOLPW.

##### Using Nginx
Run nginx with the following config in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:

```
server {
    listen       80;
	location / {
	    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
	    if ($http_authorization ~* "^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ROML2P775VPAT7RLPOWU") {
           # proxy the request to Minio-1
	       proxy_pass http://localhost:9001;
	    }
	    if ($http_authorization ~* "^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ENT3GYJCKCD1Q79XLP4C") {
           # proxy the request to Minio-2
	       proxy_pass http://localhost:9002;
	    }
	    if ($http_authorization ~* "^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=C988WQ23D98207ELOLPW") {
           # proxy the request to Minio-3
	       proxy_pass http://localhost:9003;
	    }
    }
}
```

##### Using Traefik
Traefik can be downloaded from https://traefik.io/

`traefik.toml` config file:

```
defaultEntryPoints = ["http"]

[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"

[file]
watch = true

[backends]
  [backends.backend1]
    [backends.backend1.servers.server1]
      url = "http://localhost:9001"

  [backends.backend2]
    [backends.backend2.servers.server1]
      url = "http://localhost:9002"

  [backends.backend3]
    [backends.backend3.servers.server1]
      url = "http://localhost:9003"

[frontends]
    [frontends.frontend1]
    backend = "backend1"
    passHostHeader = true
    [frontends.frontend1.routes.test_1]
    rule = "HeadersRegexp: Authorization, ^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ROML2P775VPAT7RLPOWU"

    [frontends.frontend2]
    backend = "backend2"
    passHostHeader = true
    [frontends.frontend2.routes.test_1]
    rule = "HeadersRegexp: Authorization, ^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=ENT3GYJCKCD1Q79XLP4C"

    [frontends.frontend3]
    backend = "backend3"
    passHostHeader = true
    [frontends.frontend3.routes.test_1]
    rule = "HeadersRegexp: Authorization, ^AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=C988WQ23D98207ELOLPW"
```
